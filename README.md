🛠️ Project Journey: Building the Task Scheduler
This project was my introduction to PartyRock and the first part of the 30-day challenge. The initial goal was to create a task scheduler, so I followed along with the prompts and got it working pretty easily.
🔹 Improving the Scheduler
Once I had the basic setup running, I started thinking—what if you already have plans? That night, I had a dinner theater date with my wife, and I wanted my scheduler to account for pre-existing events. So, I adjusted the app to allow users to input previous plans alongside new tasks.
🔹 Refining the Look & Feel
After testing it out, I realized the UI felt a bit clunky. So, I tweaked the layout to make it look better and function more smoothly.
🔹 Final Outcome & Where to Use It
Now, whenever I need a task scheduler, I use this link:
🔗 TaskSync Planner
This way, no excuses for skipping workouts—even when there’s a date night! 💪🔥

This keeps it clear, engaging, and personal while maintaining a solid structure! Let me know if you’d like any tweaks! 😎
