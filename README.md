## 🛠️ Project Journey: Building the Task Scheduler

### 🔹 Final Version: AI-Generated Images & Motivation  
Refined the UI to make it **look better and function more smoothly**.  
Now, the TaskSync Planner **randomly selects a task from your list** and generates an AI-powered **image** to visualize it.  
Plus, I added a **motivational quote** to keep users inspired while planning their day!
